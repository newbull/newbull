The original block reward schedule:
I am sorry, I forgot it.


## 3. Misc:
Bitcoin: Diffculty is start with 1 I think, And adjustment every 14 days. Generate the block every 600 seconds.
Dogecoin: Diffculty is start with 0x00000f, And adjustment every 4 hours. Generate the block every 60 seconds.
NewBull: Diffculty is start with 0x0000ff for now*, And adjustment every 14 days. Generate the block every 180 seconds.
# * I am sorry, I have lost my old version source code, and I forgot the diffculty about old version. I just remeber that I have tried "diff adjustment per block" and "diff addjustment every 14 days", and maybe switched between these scenarios several times.

### Warning

## 1. Qt Wallet Gui Deprecated

It's very powerful. But I developed a simple one instead.

## 2. Corrupted Blockchain data file

I don't know what caused the blockchain data file to be corrupted. But it is estimated that hundreds or thousands of blocks and rewards have been lost.
So, the -reindex can not be use, and I developed a php version block parse tools to parse the transactions.
